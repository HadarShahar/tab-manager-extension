# tab-manager-extension
A chrome extension that manages your tabs across multiple devices using google firebase.
In order to make it work, you have to create a firebase project and saved the generated config object in the file firebaseConfig.js

- You can save your current tabs in a group with a name, and open it later.
- These tabs will be saved in your firebase project, and thus can be accessed and modified from any other computer!
- Another (unrelated) feature is translating the selected text in the current tab using morfix dictionary.
